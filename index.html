      <h1>Stuart&ensp;Nixon</h1>
      <h2>Full-stack web developer with Le Wagon</h2>
      <p>
        'Multipotentialite'. Background in media production and marketing, with experience in graphic design and film/video. I’m also a linguistics enthusiast. Coming from the country of eleven official languages, South Africa, and having spent the last five years based in South Korea as a language teacher and learner, I am invested in language and education. I wanted to upskill and take on new challenges in another country, so here I am in China with Le Wagon! My greatest interest at the moment is at the intersection of language/education and technology. I believe in the power of both languages and tech to bridge divides. That’s where coding comes in. Plus I see having coding skills and digital proficiency as an investment in the future. After Le Wagon, I aim to continue to sharpen my skills and use them to find new career opportunities.
